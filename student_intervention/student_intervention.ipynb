    "A really simple process that is analagous to a decision tree is a decision flowchart (which almost any organization would use) - thus, decision trees are easy to explain conceptually to a non-technical audience. This is because they seem to mirror how people would naturally think about processes and problems. As a result, decision trees (or decision charts) are widely used in business to model processes. A more technical example of the usage of decision trees would be its use in random forests, where a possible application is classifying junk mail.\n",

    "It's also straightforward to visualize what is happening at each branch. However, the decision tree loses its interpretability the deeper it is - they can quickly become too complex to explain. Decision trees are also prone to overfitting, but this can be mitigated by cross-validation of the predictions and pruning of the decision tree. Decision trees perform very well when the data is separated cleanly parallel to any axis (since this is by nature what a decision tree does).\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose decision trees as my first classifier because it's one of the simplest choices, and acts as a good benchmark against future methods. For example, if the data is not separated parallel to its axes, we can use a variety of other methods that might compensate for this, such as SVM."

The strengths of the model are fast computation time, since it is not very processor intensive to implement. It works poorly when the nature of the relation between the predictor and response does not follow the logistic function, which looks similar to a population growth graph.\n",

One possible concern for logistic regression is that its $F_1$ score seemed to be inconsistent in that there was a large jump between the results of a sample of 200 and 300. I'm inclined to believe that this is just variance due to overfitting being mitigated as the sample size grows, since the training score is consistently dropping.\n",

    "Another reason why I believe logistic regression to be superior is its computational complexity. Logistic regression generally scales linearly with the training size, whereas SVM scales in polynomial time, and is generally $O(n^2)$ or $O(n^3)$, depending on the implementation. The reason I compare SVM and Logistic Regression is that in this case they seem to be similar in terms of accuracy. Should the schoolboard decide to scale up the size of their datasets, logistic regression may be able to deliver superior speed and comparable (if not better) performance, and so appears to be the best choice."

    "Here is some of the intuition behind it. Suppose you have a series of red and blue dots as pictured below (ignore the green line and dotted orange line for now). If we were given a random dot somewhere within the range of the graph, and asked to predict whether it would be blue or red we could do it as so. If it's on the far left, it'll most likely be red - we know this because the density of reds is much higher, and there's not a blue dot to be seen on the left. Conversely if it were on the far right, it would most likely be blue. However if the dot were in middle, it wouldn't be as clear cut."

    "So we know that starting on the far left, there's basically no chance that the dot is blue, and as we go farther to the right the chance that the dot is blue increases. We can visualize the chance that the dot is blue by looking at the green line. Logistic regression assumes that the relationship follows something called a *logistic function*, which you can remember as a soft S-shaped curve. This is essentially how logistic regression works: it gives you the probability of something falling within a certain class.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does logistic regression find this curve? A simple heuristic you can use is to think about the \"density\" of the dots in the area. For example, to the far left it seems as if all of them are red, and similarly for blue on the right. In the middle, there seems to be something closer to a mix of the two, so we can't be as sure. If we repeat this for all the intermediate positions, and assume the relation is clearly separated and smooth, then we will get something like the logistic function."

    "I use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. I also use stratified shuffle split along with cross validation. This is because it seems as if the data may have been imbalanced from earlier. Specifically, the values at 100, 200, and 300 samples for $R_1$ score were 0.76, 0.76 and 0.82, which suggests that the last third of the data may have had a disporportionate effect on the predictions."
