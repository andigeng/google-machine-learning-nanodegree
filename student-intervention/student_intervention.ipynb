This is because they seem to mirror how people would naturally think about processes and problems. It's also fairly straightforward to visualize what is happening at each branch. However, the decision tree loses its interpretability the deeper it is - they can quickly become too complex to explain. Decision trees are also prone to overfitting, but this can be mitigated by cross-validation of the predictions and pruning of the decision tree. Decision trees perform very well when the data is separated cleanly parallel to any axis (since this is by nature what a decision tree does)."

The strengths of the model are fast computation time, since it is not very processor intensive to implement.
